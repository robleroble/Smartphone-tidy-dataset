# Smartphone-tidy-dataset
The final assignment for Coursera's Getting and Cleaning Data course

This assignment takes data collected from smartphone accelerometer devices. The following steps were used to clean and process the data:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The run_analysis.R file includes comments that explains what work is performed with the available datasets and how it is transformed and merged to create the final tidy dataset.
